          <p class="lead">
            Hi there!
          </p >
          <p >
            We're Ori Vered and Damian Tissembaum, a pair of computer science students from Hadassah Academic College.
          </p>
          <p>
            We both love wines and liqueurs from around the world. We believe that everyone should have a chance to learn about and enjoy them, no matter where they are. This idea is what inspired us to create this app.
          </p>
          <p>
            Our app is your personal guide to spirits and wines from all over the globe. From the vineyards of Italy to the whiskey distilleries of Scotland, we've gathered information to help you explore and enjoy these amazing drinks.
          </p>
          <p>
            But our app is more than just a guide. It's a place for people who love wines and spirits to come together. Here, you can discover new flavors, share your thoughts, and learn more about your favorite drinks.
          </p>
          <p>
            Creating this app has been a lot of hard work, but we've loved every minute of it. We're always looking for ways to make it better, so we'd love to hear your feedback and suggestions.
          </p>
          <p>
            So why not pour yourself a glass and start exploring with us? Here's to a world of amazing drinks, waiting for you to discover.
          </p>
          <p class="lead">Cheers! <br> Ori and Damian.</p>
